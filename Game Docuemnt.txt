Game Overview

Philosophy

The main reason for developing this game was to modernize an old classic game. Scorched Earth was for the 

s to breath new life into an old classic game that was loved by many. Even though the physics of the original game have aged well, the graphics and overall look and feel of the game has not. The main goal of this game is to keep the underlying game mechanics of the original game while adding new and improved graphics and gameplay that compliment the original game.
